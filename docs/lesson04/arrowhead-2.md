# Arrowhead

For a given odd integer number `n` draw an arrowhead like it's shown on the image:

![screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lesson04/arrowhead.jpg)

The number `n` represents the number of asterisks in the bottom level of the arrowhead. 

Your arrowhead will have 1 asterisk character at the top level, 3 at the 2nd to top level, 5 at the 3rd level, and so on, until it reaches the bottom level. After the bottom level you should have three lines with a single asterisk to represent the trunk. 

Note that the left side of the base of the tree should line up with the left side of the console window.
