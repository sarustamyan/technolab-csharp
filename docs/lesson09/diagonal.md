# Diagonal

Write a metod that returns the items in the diagonal of a given square matrix of integers. See the signature of the method on [GitHub](https://github.com/sarustamyan/technolab-csharp-sources/blob/master/Homework/Lesson6/Diagonal/Program.cs) 

Example: for the following matrix:

```
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9
```

the method should return `[1, 5, 9]`.

**Bonus Points:** Create a method to return the reverse diagonal, i.e. in the case above it would be `[3, 5, 7]`
