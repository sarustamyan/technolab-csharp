# Type of a Sentence

For a given sentence, print its type based on the following rules:

* `Interrogative` sentences end with a question mark
* `Exclamatory` sentences end with an exclamation mark
* All other sentences are considered `Declarative`.

E.g. for the following text: `I ate a snail.` the program should output `Declarative`, whereas for this sentence `I ate a snail!` the output should be `Exclamatory`
