# Last Positive

Print the last positive number in a given array of integers. 

E.g. for `[1, 3, 5, -1, 6]` the output should be `6`, whereas for `[1, 3, 5, -1, -6]` the output should be `5`

**Bonus point:** Print the 0-based index of the last positive number instead of the the number itself. I.e. in the examples about for the first one the output should be `4`, while for the second one it should be `2`
