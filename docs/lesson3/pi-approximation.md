# Approximation of π

For the given number of iterations `n` calculate approximation of π using the [Leibniz formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)

Note that Leibniz's formula converges extremely slowly, so you'll need *a lot* of iterations. How many iterations till you get the 5th decimal point correctly?
